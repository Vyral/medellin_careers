Welcome to my new recruiting blog, Agent Hype! We know agents all across the country and in the Bay Area, and we needed a way to share what’s working for our team and what is not. **This will be our platform to share ideas and concepts with you that will hopefully improve your business.**

**We’ll be talking about marketing tools, systems that we use, technology, concepts, ideas, and other things that we use on a daily basis.** Hopefully this will spark some creativity into you and your business.

We just want this to be a collaborative spot to share ideas and help each other succeed. Thanks for tuning in, and expect at least two educational videos per month from us!
