One thing you should make sure of is pursuing pre-approval. It should be from a respectable lender. Additionally, your form of financing is important. Conventional is a safest route, but there are many options available. The more money you can put down, the more attractive your offer will look.

A creative way to stand out is to writing a letter to the seller. Express how passionately you admire their home, and how you see your family living there. Sometimes, sellers can feel sentimental about moving out of a home, especially if they’ve raised a family in it. The letter adds emotional value to the offer.

The most important factor of your offer, however, is the amount. Don’t submit a low-ball offer. On average, sellers earn 97% to 98% of their listing price. To make sure you score the best bargain, hire a tailored real estate agent to represent you!
