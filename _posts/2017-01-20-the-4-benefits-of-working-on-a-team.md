Why should you be working on a team instead of by yourself? There are four main benefits:

1. **It improves accountability.** The most important part of being an agent, whether you’re on a team or working independently, is being held accountable. Being on a team and having a structure in place provides accountability by delegating tasks and schedules.
2. **You can become a specialist.** Real estate teams consist of buyer agents, listing agents, marketing specialists, lead generators, and administrative specialists who are all separate from each other and in control their own specific responsibilities. This specialization adds up to a service that’s far greater than the sum of its parts.
3. **It allows for greater opportunity.** Within a team, each member can provide opportunity for other members. A listing agent, for example, can provide a buyer agent with their listings so the buyer agent can host those open houses and attract more clients. Marketing specialists can also provide leads to agents from their various marketing channels.
4. **You can offer a better service value to your clients.** A team of agents all co-marketing the same listing offers more bang for their clients’ buck, so to speak.

All of these points are in sharp contrast to the prospect of working independently, where you have to juggle all aspects of the business by yourself. It’s easy for that kind of burden of responsibility to overwhelm your ability to provide good service to your clients.
